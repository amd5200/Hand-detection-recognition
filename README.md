# Hand-detection-recognition
First your system must installed OpenCV and espeak

sudo apt-get install python-xlib                                                                                                                                  
sudo apt-get install python-pip                                                                                                                                          
sudo pip install PyUserInput

then run the handetect_line.py

have fun ......

Hand detection recognition to change pictures, used opencv to control keyboard of PyUserInput.
